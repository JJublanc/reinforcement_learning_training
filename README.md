To solve prediction problems, a classic supervised machine learning model learns to predict a
output y 'based on an input x'. For this we train it on labeled data, this means that for each
individual x we ​​know the value of the variable we are trying to predict y, which is called the label.

With reinforcement learning it is not necessary to have labeled data. The algorithm learns the
better prediction thanks to a rewards function which depends on both the algorithm's prediction
and the situation in which the system in which we find ourselves is. This is why the algorithms of
reinforcement learning are said to be semi-supervised.

The following notebooks aim to help getting familiar with reinforcement learning concepts and useful tools.
